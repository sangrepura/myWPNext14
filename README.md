## FAQ

### Is there a non-demo example?

Yes! You can view a website running this code at <https://gregrickaby.com> ([github repo](https://github.com/gregrickaby/gregrickaby)).

### What happened to your old repo? The one with Docker, Mantine, and all the other stuff?

I've decided to simplify things based on the Next.js App Router. You can still [view the old repo](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress/tree/1.0.0).

### Can I hire you to build my headless WordPress site?

Yes! I'm always interested in taking on headless WordPress projects. Send an email with your budget and requirements to `greg@gregrickaby.com`

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### 3. Create a `.env.local` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Customize the URLs in `.env.local` to match your WordPress setup:

```txt
# WordPress GraphQL API URL. No trailing slash.
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_GRAPHQL_URL="https://wordpress.nextjswp.com/graphql"

# WordPress REST API URL. No trailing slash.
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_REST_API_URL="https://wordpress.nextjswp.com/wp-json/wp/v2"

# Optional. JWT auth refresh token.
#NEXTJS_AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=""

# Preview Secret. Must match the constant in wp-config.php.
NEXTJS_PREVIEW_SECRET="preview"

# Revalidation Secret. Must match the constant in wp-config.php.
NEXTJS_REVALIDATION_SECRET="revalidate"
```

### 4. Configure `next.config.js`

Update the URL in `next.config.js` to match your WordPress site:

```ts
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: '*.nextjswp.**' // <-- Change to your WordPress site
      }
    ]
  }
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### 5. Configure `/lib/config.ts`

Update the content to match your WordPress site:

```ts
const config = {
  siteName: 'Next.js WordPress',
  siteDescription: "It's headless WordPress!",
  siteUrl: 'https://nextjswp.com'
}
```

### 6. Configure WordPress

You'll need either a local or public WordPress site with the following plugins:

- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) (free version is fine)
- [Next.js WordPress Plugin](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress-plugin)
- [Next.js WordPress Theme](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress-theme)
- [WPGraphQL Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/add-wpgraphql-seo/)
- [WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.wpgraphql.com/acf/)
- [WPGraphQL JWT Authentication](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication) (optional)
- [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)
- [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

After installing all the plugins mentioned above, you'll need to add some constants to your `wp-config.php` file:

```php
// The URL of your Next.js frontend. Include the trailing slash.
define( 'NEXTJS_FRONTEND_URL', 'https://nextjswp.com/' );

// Optional. JWT auth refresh token.
//define( 'GRAPHQL_JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY', '' );

// Any random string. This must match the .env variable in the Next.js frontend.
define( 'NEXTJS_PREVIEW_SECRET', 'preview' );

// Any random string. This must match the .env variable in the Next.js frontend.
define( 'NEXTJS_REVALIDATION_SECRET', 'revalidate' );
```

### 7. Optional. Authentication for Previews

In order to query draft posts for Previews, you'll need to authenticate with WordPress. The following is a one-time step:

- Install and activate the [WPGraphQL JWT Authentication](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication) plugin
- Generate a random string. I recommend using the [WordPress salt generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/)
- Copy the string
- Open your `wp-config.php` file, and paste the string into the `GRAPHQL_JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` constant. (Be sure to uncomment the constant by removing the `//` symbols.)

```php
// Optional. JWT auth refresh token.
define( 'GRAPHQL_JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY', 'some-random-string-generated-by-wp-salt' );
```

- Go to **GraphQL -> GraphiQL IDE** in your WordPress admin
- Copy the following and paste into GraphiQL IDE (replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your WordPress credentials)

```graphql
mutation Login {
  login(
    input: {
      clientMutationId: "uniqueId"
      password: "your_password"
      username: "your_username"
    }
  ) {
    refreshToken
  }
}
```

- Click the **Play** button in GraphiQL to run the mutation
- Copy the `refreshToken` returned by the mutation
- Open the Next.js `.env.local` file, and paste the `refreshToken` into the `NEXTJS_AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN` variable. (Be sure to uncomment the variable by removing the `#` symbol.)

```txt
# Optional. JWT auth refresh token.
NEXTJS_AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN="refresh-token-generated-by-grapqh-query"
```

You should now be able to preview draft posts in your Next.js app by clicking the **Preview** button in your WordPress admin.

### 8. Start the dev servers

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the dev server has started, you can view the front-end: <http://localhost:3000>

## Querying WordPress data with GraphQL

GraphQL is efficient because we can query multiple endpoints in a single request. If we were to use the WordPress REST-API, we would need to make multiple round trips to each respective endpoint.

We can build our queries in GraphiQL (or your favorite REST client) and let `JSON.stringify()` format it. Because this is all standard JavaScript, we can even pass variables to our queries-- no need for a 3rd party package!

Here is a query to fetch a single post (based on the slug), the featured image, author meta, categories, tags, SEO, and post comments:

```ts
import {Post} from '@/lib/types'

/**
 * Fetch a single post by slug.
 */
export async function getPostBySlug(slug: string) {
  // Define our query.
  const query = `
    query GetPost($slug: ID!) {
      post(id: $slug, idType: SLUG) {
        databaseId
        content(format: RENDERED)
        title(format: RENDERED)
        featuredImage {
          node {
            altText
            mediaDetails {
              sizes(include: MEDIUM) {
                height
                width
                sourceUrl
              }
            }
          }
        }
        author {
          node {
            avatar {
              url
            }
            name
          }
        }
        date
        tags {
          nodes {
            databaseId
            name
          }
        }
        categories {
          nodes {
            databaseId
            name
          }
        }
        seo {
          metaDesc
          title
        }
        comments(first: 30, where: {order: ASC}) {
          nodes {
            content(format: RENDERED)
            databaseId
            date
            status
            author {
              node {
                avatar {
                  url
                }
                email
                name
                url
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `

  // Define our variables.
  const variables = {
    slug: slug
  }

  // Fetch the data using a reusable fetch function. Next.js
  // automatically memoizes and caches these requests.
  const response = await fetchGraphQL(query, variables)

  // Return the post.
  return response.data.post as Post
}
```

This repo does not use a 3rd party GraphQL package, because Next.js automatically memoizes the `fetch()` requests in our custom fetch function. This means that if we fetch the same data twice, Next.js will only make one request to WordPress.

> If you prefer use a 3rd party GraphQL package, simply swap out the custom `fetchGraphQL()` function.
